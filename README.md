# Analysis 
The dataset was optimized to predict whether applicants funded by Alphabet Soup would be successful. Categorical variables were encoded using pd.get_dummies. After fine-tuning hyperparameters like epochs, activation functions, and the number of layers, the neural network model accurately predicted outcomes about 73-74% of the time.
